Version 4 is my schedule of choice.
I will be able to easily modify version 4 with an earlier start and later afternoon session.
My desire is to have 3 projects I am proud of completed by June 19th. 
This schedule is the one that will likely lead to my first job as a web developer.
Getting my first job as a web developer ASAP is the goal.
