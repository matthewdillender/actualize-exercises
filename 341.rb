# Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

t = "Crime and Punishment"
a = "Dosteovsky"

pp "My favorite work of classic fiction might be #{t} by #{a}."

# I understood tne syntax after a couple problems so was able to complete from memory.

# I will revisit more challengind conditionals problems tomorrow.
