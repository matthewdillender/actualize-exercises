My name is Matt Dillender. I am excited for this opportuntiy to learn and explore the vast world of software engineering. My vocational orientation has been towards service work in various forms.
As an entrepreneur I have enjoyed the use of personal websites, scheduling apps, and online marketing strategies to run my business.
My goals are to remain process oriented with a positive attitude and develop several portfolio projects that reflect my personal interests.
